## Abstract
Biodiversity influences multiple ecosystem functions. It is increasingly clear that biodiversity belowground also influences multiple ecosystem functions. Yet, it is unclear whether differences in above-belowground species composition (β-diversity) are associated with differences in multiple ecosystem functions (e.g., spatial turnover in ecosystem function). Here we partitioned the contributions of above and belowground β-diversity and abiotic factors (geographic distance, differences in environments) on the spatial turnover of multiple ecosystem functions. We compiled a dataset of plant and soil microbial communities and six indicators of grassland functions (i.e., plant aboveground biomass, plant nitrogen (N), plant phosphorus (P), root biomass, soil total N and soil extractable P) from the platform of Nutrient Network at 18 grassland sites on four continents. We used Mantel tests and structural equation models to disentangle the relationship between β-diversity and spatial turnover in grassland functions. We found that the effects of abiotic factors on the spatial turnover of multiple ecosystem functions were largely indirect through their influences on above-belowground β-diversity, and that the spatial turnover of ecosystem function is more associated with plant β-diversity than with soil microbial β-diversity. These results indicate that differences in above-belowground species composition is one of the mechanisms that interacts with environmental change to determine variability in multiple ecosystem functions across spatial scales. As grasslands face global threats from shrub encroachment, conversion to agriculture, or are lost to development, the functions and servers they provide will more converge with an increased in aboveground community homogenization than with soil microbial community homogenization.
